## About Me

I am a driven and ambitious full-stack developer, with a background in analytics and merchandising from working with two of the UK’s largest retailers. I have experience in working with large data sets and have worked cross-functionally with several teams, including Machine Learning specialists and Business Analysts. 

My love of learning, along with the satisfaction I get when solving a problem led me to pursue a career in software development. As a recent graduate from Makers Academy (Europe's leading coding bootcamp), I have learnt a number of technical skills including Agile development and TDD, as well as softer skills such as understanding different communication styles, team-working skills and pair programming - all of which are essential in delivering high-quality projects on time.
 
I am looking for a software development role which will allow me to further develop my technical and non-technical skills, with the opportunity to learn new technologies and processes in a practical environment.

## Currently Working On

- Working on a pro bono project for the AgeUK charity to enhance their current volunteer management system. The project is in the planning stages, where we are exploring the most appropriate technologies to use that meet the client's requirements. One of the options discussed was to use Ruby on Rails and [Administrate](https://github.com/thoughtbot/administrate) - a demo of the basic interface was built for the client and can be viewed [here](https://github.com/Dhara-95/Admin_App). Using [Airtable's](https://airtable.com/) interface is also another option we are exploring. 

- Upskilling myself and learning [React](https://reactjs.org/) using the [Makers Adademy React course](https://github.com/makersacademy/react/tree/master/units/tdd), as well as through online tutorials and resources such as the [Udemy - React Basics](https://www.udemy.com/course/react-basic-in-just-1-hour/) course. 

- Recently started learning [Java](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/7/docs/technotes/guides/language/) using [Codeacademy](https://www.codecademy.com/learn/learn-java) to understand how it compares to other OOP languages that I am familiar with (Ruby and JavaScript).

Please see my full Github repository list [here](https://github.com/Dhara-95?tab=repositories).


## Skills

#### Excellent Communicator

- My excellent communication and team-working skills strengthened whilst working at ASOS.com. Working cross-functionally on projects required liaising with multiple stakeholders across various functions, including the machine learning team. This gave me invaluable insight into how tech teams work with clients, as well as an understanding of when best to exchange information to align with their working sprints.

- At Makers, my strong communication skills were demonstrated when working on several group projects. Teamwork and communication were particularly important in our final project - we ensured to have regular stand-ups and retrospective meetings, which helped to build a great relationship within the team. This was especially important as we were all working remotely.

#### Analytical and Problem Solving Mindset

- My analytical abilities strengthened throughout my time at ASOS.com. This was demonstrated when I helped develop an Excel pricing model, which provided formula-based pricing recommendations for a sale event across Middle Eastern countries. The success of the model was shown in the KPI's, for example, new customer growth in Saudia Arabia was higher than Black Friday and increased by +2%.  

- More recently at Makers, I learnt how to effectively de-bug by following the stack trace and gaining visibility of the error, which proved to be important during our final project. Whilst coding in a new language, we came across various blockers that we were able to successfully de-bug, using the skills developed throughout the course. 

#### Mentoring

-  I believe that my approachability, empathetic nature and understanding how to build strong professional relationships, has led me to train and mentor several individuals. I have had the opportunity to develop my mentoring skills throughout my professional career and at Makers, by mentoring several colleagues and students. I have found this to be a rewarding experience and hope to be able to continue mentoring, in some capacity, within a software development role.

## Experience

[**ASOS.com**](https://www.asosplc.com/) **(May 2018 - May 2020)**    
*Assistant Pricing Merchandiser*  
- Reviewed and analysed large data sets across multiple global markets, to provide strategic pricing recommendations for up to 85,000 products using my strong analytical skills in Excel.
- Provided business critical pricing recommendations to the CEO, largely based upon the data analysis I carried out using internal and external data systems, which helped to potentialise on sales and contributed to new customer growth. 
- Worked with internal clients to deliver projects based on their requirements. This experience of working with clients will help in a software development role, to transform an idea into a working product. 
- Built strong professional relationships with colleagues (within Tech, Finance, Insight & Analytics, Marketing, Logistics and Buying & Merchandising), by working cross-functionally and utilising my strong communication skills.

[**Arcadia Group Ltd, Miss Selfridge**](https://www.arcadiagroup.co.uk/) **(September 2016 - May 2018)**   
*Senior Merchandising Admin Assistant*  
- Analysed sales data to provide regular performance reporting for my team and presented KPI’s to senior management in weekly trade meetings. 
- Effective analysis underpinned this role, which I believe I was able to achieve with my improved time management skills and efficiency, whilst maintaining a high level of accuracy. My attention to detail and time management has helped when striving for professional code quality and the delivery of projects in a small timeframe, during my journey into learning software development. 
- Utilised my strong communication skills to liaise between external suppliers and worked collaboratively with Arcadia’s Logistics team, to ensure efficient stock movement between the warehouse and stores.
- Learnt how to work cross-functionally, manage workloads and prioritise tasks effectively, whilst working in a fast-paced environment. This will be an essential skill in a software development role, where good teamwork and ticket prioritisation are key.
