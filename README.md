## Skills

#### Communication skills

- In my previous career, effective and clear communication was essential in order to complete projects that involved a number of stakeholders from various different functions.
- Working cross functionally in previous job roles has allowed me to gain confidence and strengthen my communication skills, which I believe is essential for a junior developer working within a wider team.

#### Analytical skills

- During my time at ASOS.com my analytical skills strengthened further, with my knowledge of Excel improving greatly.
- This was largely due to gaining increased autonomy over a number of pricing tests and projects, where consistency and accuracy of reporting were vital, to ensure the risks and negative commercial impacts were kept to a minimum.
- I believe that my strong analytical skills are transferrable into a junior developer role as will aid in effective problem solving that I am likely to encounter on a daily basis.

## Experience

**ASOS.com** (May 2018 - May 2020)    
*Assistant Pricing Merchandiser*  
- Reviewed, maintained and managed prices for our entire product assortment and across multiple global markets, under the direction of the Pricing Manager. 
- Responsible for consolidating weekly, monthly and quarterly reports across key customer and business metrics, to be shared with the Pricing Team and senior management. Consistency and accuracy of reporting were essential in order to ensure the risks and negative commercial impacts were kept to a minimum.  
- Provided business critical pricing recommendations to the CEO, largely based upon the data analysis I carried out using various internal and external systems, which ultimately helped to potentialise on sales and contributed to bottom line profit. 
- Built strong professional relationships with colleagues (within Finance, Insights & Analytics, Marketing and Tech), by working cross functionally and utilising my strong communication skills. I believe this skill will help me to pair program and problem solve effectively in a software development role.

**Arcadia Group Ltd, Miss Selfridge** (September 2016 - May 2018)   
*Senior Merchandising Admin Assistant*  
- Analysed sales data to provide regular reporting for my team and presented KPI’s to senior management. 
- Created both promotional and sales plans for stock movement throughout the network of UK and international stores, to potentialise sales and minimise the risk to the business.
- Effective analysis underpinned this role, which I believe I was able to achieve with my improved time management skills and efficiency, whilst maintaining a high level of accuracy.
- Liaised between external suppliers and worked cross-functionally within Arcadia, to ensure efficient stock movement between the warehouse and stores.
- During my time at Arcadia I learnt how to manage workloads and prioritise tasks effectively, whilst working in a fast-paced environment, which will be an essential transferable skill into software development.

## Achievements and Interests

- Selected by the Merchandising Director to take part in Arcadia’s ‘Buddy Scheme’ where I was responsible for an apprentice’s progression and training during their time at Arcadia. I have also recently joined the mentor scheme at Makers Academy where I am able to mentor a fellow Makers student, who has just started the course. 

- Nominated as the Joint Honours course representative at the University of Southampton.

- Involvement in international charity projects, including refurbishing a local school in Uzbekistan and teaching English to young children attending the school.

- More recently I have started yoga and meditation to help keep my mind focused, whilst learning new technologies and processes throughout my Makers journey and beyond.
