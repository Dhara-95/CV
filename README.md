## Skills

#### Excellent Communicator

- Strong communication is essential for a junior developer working within a wider tech team. At Makers my strong communication skills were demonstrated when working on a number of group projects throughout the course. Teamwork and communication were particularly import in our final project, where we set a daily schedule to ensure regular stand-ups and retrospective meetings. These sessions were used to communicate on completed tickets, what each individual or pair was working on and if we faced any challenges. This helped to build a great relationship within the team, which was especially important as we were all working remotely. 

- My excellent communication and teamworking skills have also been strengthened whilst working at ASOS.com. I worked cross-functionally on the majority of projects, which required liaising with a number of stakeholders across various functions (e.g. Tech, Finance, Insight & Analytics and Buying & Merchandising). Therefore effective communication was essential in delivering projects on time. 

#### Analytical and Problem Solving Mindset

- Analysis underpinned my role at ASOS.com, where I reviewed and analysed large data sets to provide effective pricing recommendations. My analytical abilities were demonstrated when I helped develop a successful Excel pricing model, which provided formula-based pricing recommendations for sale events across the entire product assortment. 

- More recently, at Makers I learnt how to effectively de-bug by 'tightening the loop' (following the error stack trace) and 'gaining visibility' (adding print statements to understand what was causing the error). This was a particulary important skill for our final project as we were using a new language, and although we came across a number of errors, we were able to successfully de-bug them using the skills developed throughout the course. 

#### Fast Learner 

-  At Makers being a fast learner and understanding new technical processes was essential to complete weekly challenges and group projects. The course required a high level of self-led learning, which I have shown throughout the course by learning new languages in short timeframes. An example of this is reflected in our final project, where my team and I learnt the fundementals of mobile app development to build an iOS app in under two weeks, using an entirely new tech stack.

## Experience

**ASOS.com** (May 2018 - May 2020)    
*Assistant Pricing Merchandiser*  
- Reviewed, maintained and managed prices for our entire product assortment and across multiple global markets, under the direction of the Pricing Manager. 
- Responsible for consolidating weekly, monthly and quarterly reports across key customer and business metrics, to be shared with the Pricing Team and senior management. Consistency and accuracy of reporting were essential in order to ensure the risks and negative commercial impacts were kept to a minimum.  
- Provided business critical pricing recommendations to the CEO, largely based upon the data analysis I carried out using various internal and external systems, which ultimately helped to potentialise on sales and contributed to bottom line profit. 
- Built strong professional relationships with colleagues (within Finance, Insights & Analytics, Marketing and Tech), by working cross functionally and utilising my strong communication skills. I believe this skill will help me to pair program and problem solve effectively in a software development role.

**Arcadia Group Ltd, Miss Selfridge** (September 2016 - May 2018)   
*Senior Merchandising Admin Assistant*  
- Analysed sales data to provide regular reporting for my team and presented KPI’s to senior management. 
- Created both promotional and sales plans for stock movement throughout the network of UK and international stores, to potentialise sales and minimise the risk to the business.
- Effective analysis underpinned this role, which I believe I was able to achieve with my improved time management skills and efficiency, whilst maintaining a high level of accuracy.
- Liaised between external suppliers and worked cross-functionally within Arcadia, to ensure efficient stock movement between the warehouse and stores.
- During my time at Arcadia I learnt how to manage workloads and prioritise tasks effectively, whilst working in a fast-paced environment, which will be an essential transferable skill into software development.

## Achievements and Interests

- Selected by the Merchandising Director to take part in Arcadia’s ‘Buddy Scheme’ where I was responsible for an apprentice’s progression and training during their time at Arcadia. I have also recently joined the mentor scheme at Makers Academy where I am a mentor to students who have just started the course. 

- Nominated as the Joint Honours course representative at the University of Southampton.

- More recently I have started yoga and meditation to help keep my mind focused, whilst learning new technologies and processes throughout my Makers journey and beyond.
