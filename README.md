## Dhara Patel

Currently studying Software Engineering through Makers Academy. Looking for a junior developer role that will utilise my strong communication and analytical skills.

## Skills

#### Communication skills

- In my previous career, effective and clear communication was essential in order to complete projects that involved a number of stakeholders from various different functions.
- Working cross functionally in previous job roles has allowed me to gain confidence and strengthen my communication skills, which I believe is essential for a junior developer working within a wider team.

#### Analytical skills

- During my time at ASOS.com my analytical skills strengthened further, with my knowledge of Excel improving greatly.
- This was largely due to gaining increased autonomy over a number of pricing tests and projects, where consistency and accuracy of reporting were vital, to ensure the risks and negative commercial impacts were kept to a minimum.
- I believe that my strong analytical skills are transferrable into a junior developer role as will aid in effective problem solving that I am likely to encounter on a daily basis.

## Experience

**ASOS.com** (May 2018 - May 2020)    
*Assistant Pricing Merchandiser*  
- My role at ASOS involved reviewing, maintaining and managing prices for our entire product assortment and across multiple global markets, under the direction of the Pricing Manager.
- The Pricing Team at ASOS were responsible for providing business critical pricing recommendations to the CEO, largely based upon the data analysis I provided using various internal and external systems, which helped to potentialise on sales and contributed to the business' bottom line profit.
- As mentioned previously, during my time at ASOS I was able to further develop both my communication and analytical skills, which will help me to pair program and problem solve effectively in a software development role.

**Arcadia Group Ltd, Miss Selfridge** (September 2016 - May 2018)   
*Senior Merchandising Admin Assistant*  
- My role entailed analysing various forms of sales data in order to create daily, weekly and monthly reports for my team, as well as collating company KPI data to feedback and present to senior management.
- This role also involved creating promotional sales plans for where stock should be allocated throughout the network of UK and international stores, in order to minimise risk and maximise profits.
- During my time at Arcadia I was able to strengthen my communication skills but also learnt how to manage workloads and prioritise tasks effectively, whilst working in a fast-paced environment, which will be an essential transferable skill into software development.

## Achievements and Interests

- Selected by the Merchandising Director to take part in Arcadia’s ‘Buddy Scheme’ where I was responsible for an apprentice’s progression and training during their time at Arcadia. I have also recently joined the mentor scheme at Makers Academy where I am able to mentor a fellow Makers student, who has just started the course. 

- Nominated as the Joint Honours course representative at the University of Southampton.

- Involvement in international charity projects, including refurbishing a local school in Uzbekistan and teaching English to young children attending the school.

- More recently I have started yoga and meditation to help keep me focused whilst learning at Makers Academy.
